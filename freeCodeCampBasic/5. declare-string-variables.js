/* Declare String Variables
Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;
But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively. */



var myFirstName = 'Riwanto';
var myLastName = 'Sitinjak';
