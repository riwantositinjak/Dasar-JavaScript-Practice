/* Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar. */

let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
