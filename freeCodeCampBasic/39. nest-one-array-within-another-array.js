/* Nest one Array within Another Array
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray. */

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [["Riwanto Sitinjak"], ["Lestaria Sitinjak"]];
