/* Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail. */

// Test
function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const myVar = "";
  console.log("inside myLocalScope", myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log("outside myLocalScope", myVar);
