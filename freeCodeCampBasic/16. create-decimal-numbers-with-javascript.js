/* Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: when you compute numbers, they are computed with finite precision. Operations using floating points may lead to different results than the desired outcome. If you are getting one of these results, open a topic on the freeCodeCamp forum.

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7). */

const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
let myDecimal = 7.5;
